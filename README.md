# Boilergrams

Derived from a Hackathon I won: https://devpost.com/software/boilergrams

### Usage

Made using Fresh and deployed with DenoDeploy. Learn about it here https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
